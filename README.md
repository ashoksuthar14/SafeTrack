# Railway Track Defect Detection Using Acoustic Waves & Computer Vision

## Project Overview

This project is focused on using **acoustic wave analysis** and **computer vision techniques** to detect defects in railway tracks. Early detection of defects is crucial for maintaining the safety and efficiency of railway operations, and this project leverages AI and ML techniques to automate the defect detection process.

### Key Features:
- **Acoustic Wave Analysis**: Captures and analyzes sound data from sensors placed along railway tracks.
- **Computer Vision**: Visual analysis using machine learning models to identify cracks, breaks, and other structural issues.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: The system can process and alert about defects in real-time.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: With enough data, the system predicts possible future defects for proactive track maintenance.
